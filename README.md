Analyze the behaviour of e-mobility drivers in Switzerland using data from public and private charging stations (anonymized data). The goal is to identify charging patterns and get a better understanding of the driving and charging behaviour of e-mobility drivers.

Goal:

Find answers to questions regarding mobility and charging behavior in the new era of electric mobility.

Idea:

Analyze open and historical data to get a clear understanding of the situation regarding electric cars by answering questions like the following: - How and when do people move? - How, when and where do people charge their electric cars? - How does a public charging station compare to a private one in terms of utilization, time of use etc.? - â€¦?

Big Picture:

Understand the present situation regarding electric mobility in order to be able to imagine how the future will look like and plan the infrastructure development needed (electrical distribution grid, charging infrastructure at home) accordingly.

Data:
- Anonymized profiles of private charging stations in multi-family homes
- Historical data of public charging stations from ich-tanke-strom.ch
- Open data from other sources
